## 📖 About

First Line Log is a developer tool designed to help you work with Git commit messages more effectively. It focuses on the most important part of your commits - the first line, which should provide a clear, concise summary of your changes.

## ✨ Features

- View commit history in a clean, readable format
- Focus on the first line of commit messages
- Beautiful visualization of your Git history
- Quick and efficient navigation
- Perfect for code reviews and project tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started with First Line Log:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This command shows each commit on a single line, displaying only the commit hash and the first line of the commit message.

## 📝 Best Practices

When writing commit messages, make sure your first line:

- Is 50 characters or less
- Uses imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Doesn't end with a period
- Clearly summarizes the change
